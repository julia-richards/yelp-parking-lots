# Find the lowest rated parking lots in your area
## To start the app:
1. Clone the repo
2. Cd into yelpparking
3. Add a .env file with REACT_APP_API_KEY=<<your yelp api key>>
4. Navigate to https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo and click request temporary access
5. Enter "yarn start" into the terminal

**Please note that only 50 api calls are permitted every 60 minutes, changing ports by setting the .env var PORT=<<new port>> is a workaround
